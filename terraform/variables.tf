    Graviton, 4 vCPU / 32 GB. Stepped up from m8g.xlarge (16 GB) after a
    full-history Lever `resumes` backfill OOM'd ClickHouse — not the "sources
    added" trigger this comment used to name, but the same budget-outgrew-the-
    box shape. The old m8g.xlarge line-item budget (ClickHouse 6g, Metabase
    ~3g, four Airflow services ~3g, two Postgres ~0.5g, ingest bursts ~1.5g,
    host ~1g) never actually matched docker-compose.yml's real defaults — four
    Airflow services at AIRFLOW_MEM_LIMIT's own 1500m default is 6g, not 3g,
    and CLICKHOUSE_MEM_LIMIT in production's .env was 5g, not the 6g named here —
    the totals happened to land close enough (~15g of 16g) that the drift went
    unnoticed. New budget, sized against what is actually configured rather
    than restated from memory: ClickHouse 16g (mem_limit in docker-compose.yml,
    set via CLICKHOUSE_MEM_LIMIT in .env — verify with `docker inspect ...
    HostConfig.Memory`, not this comment), the four Airflow services and
    Metabase left at their proven values (6g + 2g, unchanged — neither was
    implicated in the incident), two Postgres still unbounded (small metadata
    stores), leaving ~5g of host/Docker overhead headroom — a wider margin
    than the old setup's ~1g.

    Stay on arm64. Switching architectures invalidates every image built and
    pulled into /data/docker and forces a full rebuild. r8g is the same family
    switch as m8g -> r8g: still Graviton, just memory- instead of
    compute-optimized at the same vCPU count.
